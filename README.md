# BuboDirt

This is a slightly modified version of [SuperDirt](https://github.com/musikinformatik/SuperDirt). This is the setup I use to play with [Sardine](https://sardine.raphaelforment.fr). The documentation for the original SuperDirt still applies. I'm just adding synthesizers, effects and so on when the need arises.

# Dependencies

There are a few optional dependencies that you might need to run this fork:
- [MIUgens](https://github.com/v7b1/mi-UGens) : port of Mutable Instruments Eurorack modules for SuperCollider
- [PortedPlugins](https://github.com/madskjeldgaard/portedplugins): An awesome
collection from Mads Kjeldgaard of various UGens ported to SuperCollider
